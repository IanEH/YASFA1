I use this Android app to play with ideas. A friend said it could be helpful to people who have lost the ability to speak, Stroke etc, It can be operated with one finger and can speak any number of words phases etc as long as the person or a friend adds them. 


Just by scooting about the screen[s] with a finger the words are spoken (Only English at the moment!). It is untried!


Hope it helps and I am interested in positive suggestions but time constraints limit my ability to react or support the app! 

The forms and data are stored in SQLite. The database with '.app' extension holds the forms the second with a '.db' extension holds the data. When you backup, copies of the databases are placed on the SD card. The databases can be copied to other Android devices with YASFA installed and restored. A new installation of YASFA copies the default databases from assets to the databases directory.

It runs on all the version 4.4.2 and above phones and tablets I have been able to try it on. It is more usable on a tablet.
