I use this Android app to play with ideas. A friend said it could be helpful to people who have lost the ability to speak, Stroke etc, It can be operated with one finger and can speak any number of words phases etc as long as the person or a friend adds them. 


Just by scooting about the screen[s] with a finger the words are spoken (Only English at the moment!). It is untried!


Hope it helps and I am interested in positive suggestions but time constraints limit my ability to react or support the app! 


It runs on my version 4.4.2 phone and tablet but so far I have been unable to try it on other versions of Android. 


See the MP4 files for basic instructions.
